Python Assignment-1 
Problem : If you had deposited a coin on the cryptocurrency exchange that brought 7% fixed profit daily for a week, how much would your $ 1000 reach at the end of the 7th day?
Answer :  At the beginning, our money was $1000 and increased with 7 persent interest everyday. 
If we start to calculate accordingly;
Today: 1000$
1st day: 1000 + 1000*7/100 = 1070
2nd day: 1070 + 1070*7/100 = 1144,9
3rd day: 1144,9 +1144,9*7/100 = 1225,043
4th day: 1225,043 + 1225,043*7/100 = 1310,79601
5th day: 1310,79601 + 1310,79601*7/100 = 1402,5517307
6th day: 1402,5517307 + 1402,5517307*7/100 = 1500,730351849
7th day: 1500,730351849 + 1500,730351849*7/100 =1605,78147647843 
If we want to formulate this calculation;
The increase in the capital is 1.07, with 7 percent interest every day. In other words, the money increasing by 1000 * (1.07) on the 1st day, 1000 * (1.07)*(1,07) on the 2nd day as continues to increase exponentially until the 7 th day . In this case, our formula is 1000*(1,07)^7.
We want to print this formula in Python:
Shortening i:(Capital=C,  Price=p, Daily Increase=i, Day=d, End of the Money=EM)
C=1000
p=0.7
i=1.07
d=7
print(float(C*(i)**d))
1605.7814764784307
EM = int(C*(i)**d)
print( EM â€“ C )
605

Conclusion:
At the end of seven day, our capital reached ~1605 $ and amount of increased ~605 $.
